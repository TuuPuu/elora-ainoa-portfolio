# ELORA AINOA PORTFOLIO

## A mini portfolio application used to to document Elora Ainoaâ€™s journey into Front End Development



## SUMMARY

My main goal was to build a portfolio webpage based on an initial template.
I aimed to implement CSS grids, flex box and general basic CSS styling principles to build this site.
Links are required to link down to corresponding areas on webpage
From a developer perspective, I aimed to create clear and concise code that could easily be refactored in future.
Moving forward, a lot more work needs to be put into understanding where to implement grids and when to implement CSS as a lot of debugging was required once the stylesheet was attached. 
Some HTML logic is not working. This requires future refactoring.
